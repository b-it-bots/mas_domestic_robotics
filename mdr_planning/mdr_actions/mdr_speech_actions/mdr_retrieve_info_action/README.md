## How does it work?
The `listen` part is supposed to be the action, which enables the listening mode of the robot. Once it is started, the robot listens to its environment for a certain time. If the node does not receive any input in this time, it will terminate and return a failure. On the other hand if a signal is detected then the input is processed and analyzed.
